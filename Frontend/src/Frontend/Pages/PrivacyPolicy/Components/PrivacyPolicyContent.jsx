            <h3>Pandora Privacy Policy</h3>
            <p>Last Updated: April 4, 2024  



This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and otherwise process personal data in connection with our services. This Privacy Policy is not, however, a contract and does not create any legal rights or obligations. 

Who We Are: Pandora Jewelry is a jewelry company headquartered in Copenhagen, Denmark with locations around the world. Our regional head office for Pandora Americas is in Baltimore, Maryland. When we use the terms “Pandora Jewelry”, “we”, “us” or “our” in this Privacy Policy, we are referring to Pandora Jewelry, Inc., Pandora Ventures, LLC, Pandora Ecomm, LLC, Pandora Franchising, LLC, Pandora Jewelry, LLC and any other of our affiliates.

Our Services: When we use the term “services”, we are referring to all the services that we offer on our own behalf, including without limitation, our product and service offerings and the websites and services that post or link to this Privacy Policy now or in the future.

This Privacy Policy does not cover or address, for example:</p>
<p>Job Applicants and Pandora Personnel - Personal data and privacy practices relating to job applicants, employees and other personnel;
Franchisee Stores Owned and Operated by Third Parties - Personal data and privacy practices relating to data owned and controlled by Franchisees. For personal data collected by Pandora Jewelry-branded stores owned and operated by third-parties (“Franchisees”), this Privacy Policy only applies to personal data that is processed pursuant to a transaction through our point of sale system where we are the data controller. For all other personal data collected and processed by Franchisees, they are the data controller, and this Privacy Policy does not apply. Questions or concerns regarding the privacy practices of a Franchisee location should be directed to the applicable Franchisee.
Third Party Pandora Product Sellers - Privacy practices of independent, non Pandora-branded third-party retailers that sell our products.</p>
<p>By accessing or using the services, you signify that you have read and understood to our collection, storage, use and disclosure of your personal data as described in this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use.</p>
<h3>Region-Specific Disclosures</h3>
<p>We may choose or be required by law to provide different or additional disclosures relating to the processing of personal data about residents of certain countries, regions or states. Please refer below for disclosures that may be applicable to you:

<h3>What is Personal Data?</h3>
<p>When we use the term “personal data” or “personal information” in this Privacy Policy, we mean information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, to an individual or household. It does not include aggregated or deidentified information that is maintained in a form that is not reasonably capable of being associated with or linked to you.</p>
<h3>Our Collection of Personal Data</h3>
<p>From the first moment you interact with us, we are collecting personal data about you. Sometimes we collect personal data automatically when you interact with our services and, sometimes, we collect the personal data directly from you. At times, we may collect personal data about you from other sources and third parties, even before our first direct interaction. We may link or combine your activities and information collected from you on our websites with information we have collected from you offline (e.g., in-store), information we receive from third parties, as well as information we collect automatically through tracking technologies (defined below). This allows us to provide you with a personalized experience regardless of how you interact with us. </p>
<p>Personal Data You Provide

We collect the following personal data you provide in connection with our services in-store or online:

Contact, Account and Profile Information.   We collect personal data, such as your name, email address, password, telephone number, gender, zip code, and address when you create an account, sign up for a newsletter, request a transaction or make a purchase online or in-store, consent to receive text messages, redeem or participate in a promotion, join the My Pandora rewards program, create a wishlist, purchase or redeem a gift card or otherwise communicate with us.

We may collect information when you make a purchase or request a transaction online or in-store, such as items purchased, date and time of your transaction, amount purchased, order details, whether you used a particular coupon or deal, and payment information, such as your credit/debit card or gift card details. Please note that we use third party payment processors to process credit card payments made to us. We also use third party payment plan providers to offer you additional payment options. As such, we do not retain any personally identifiable financial information in connection with credit card payments, such as credit card numbers. Rather, all such information is provided directly by you to our third-party processor. These third parties’ use of your personal data is governed by their privacy notice. </p>

We use this information to register you for My Pandora, provide you with the service, support and improve My Pandora, communicate with you and for marketing purposes.  </p>
<p>We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the services, as well as to communicate directly with you, such as to send you email messages.

We receive the same categories of personal data as described above from the following sources and third parties:

Information We Receive from Third-Party Sites You Connect to Our Services.

These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal data with us, which could include your name, email address, address book and contacts, or other information. The data we receive is dependent on that third party’s policies and your privacy settings on that third-party site. </p>

We may also collect information about you that is publicly available. We may combine this information with the information we collect from you directly.

<h3>Children’s Personal Data</h3>
<p>Our websites and online services are not directed to, and we do not intend to, or knowingly, collect or solicit personal data from children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not use our websites or online services or otherwise provide us with any personal data either directly or by other means. If a child under the age of 13 has provided personal data to us, we encourage the child’s parent or guardian to contact us to request that we remove the personal data from our systems. If we learn that any personal data we collect has been provided by a child under the age of 13, we will promptly delete that personal data.

</p>
<h3>Retention of Personal Data</h3>
<p>We retain personal data only for as long as is reasonably necessary to fulfil the purpose for which it was collected. However, if necessary, we may retain personal data for longer periods of time as required by law or as needed to resolve disputes or protect our legal rights. To determine the appropriate duration of the retention of personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of personal data and if we can attain our objectives by other means, as well as our legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other applicable obligations.

Therefore, we retain personal data for as long as the individual continues to use our services for the purposes explained in the “Our Use of Personal Data” section above. When an individual discontinues the use of our services, we will retain their personal data for as long as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes and defend claims, as well as, for any additional purpose based on the choices they have made, such as to receive marketing communications. In particular, we will retain call recordings, the personal data supplied when joining our services, including complaints, claims (for insurance products) and any other personal data supplied during the duration of an individual’s contract with us for the services, until the statutory limitation periods have expired, when this is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.

Once retention of the personal data is no longer necessary for the purposes outlined above, we will either delete or deidentify the personal data or, if this is not possible (for example, because personal data has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store the personal data and isolate it from further processing until deletion or deidentification is possible.</p>
<h3>Third-Party Websites</h3>
<p>Our websites and online services may include links to third-party websites, plug-ins and applications. Except where we post, link to or expressly adopt or refer to this Privacy Policy, this Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, any personal data practices of third-party websites and online services or the practices of other third parties. To learn about the personal data practices of third parties, please visit their respective privacy policies. </p>
<h3>Updates to This Privacy Policy</h3>

If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by email to your registered email address, by prominent posting on this website or our online services, or through other appropriate communication channels. All changes shall be effective from the date of publication unless otherwise provided.</p>

<h3>Notice of Financial Incentives and Loyalty Programs</h3>
<p>We may choose to provide programs and other offerings intended to provide benefits to eligible participants that may qualify as financial incentives, bona fide loyalty programs or other offerings (“Programs”) under certain privacy laws. Through these Programs, we may collect and retain categories of personal data described in the “Our Collection of Personal Data” section of our Privacy Policy, including Identifiers, such as your name, email address and other contact and account information; and Commercial Information, such as your purchase history and preferences. We collect this information to operate the Programs, including to send you promotions, content, and special offers and the other uses described in the Privacy Policy. The third parties that may receive access to your personal data in connection with any Program are our Program partners, analytics providers, technical service providers and third-party advertising partners.

The Programs we may provide include periodic promotional discounts and other offers, such as sweepstakes and contests; and the My Pandora rewards program, as further detailed below.

My Pandora. My Pandora is a tier-based rewards program determined by the number of points a member has earned on eligible purchases and through qualifying activities. My Pandora members enjoy certain services (e.g., wish lists) and can redeem points for rewards (e.g., discounts). Through My Pandora, we may collect certain categories of personal data set forth in the “Our Collection of Personal Data” section of our Privacy Policy, including Identifiers, such as your name, email address and other contact and account information; and Commercial Information, such as your purchase history, wishlists, and shopping and store preferences.

Interested individuals can opt-in to these Programs by following the instructions presented at the time the offer is made. Participation in the Programs is voluntary, and you may withdraw from our Programs and other offerings at any time by following the instructions provided in connection with each Program or by emailing us at usprivacy@pandora.net. 

We have determined that the value of any of these Programs and other offerings are reasonably related to the value of the personal data we would receive and otherwise process in connection with these Programs. We estimate the value of the personal data we would receive and otherwise process in connection with these Programs by considering the expense we would incur in collecting and processing the personal data, as well as the expenses related to facilitating the Program. In order to communicate and provide services to you through the Programs, we need to use your personal data. Therefore, if you choose to delete your personal data from a Program, we may no longer be able to provide you with services and benefits through the Program.</p>
