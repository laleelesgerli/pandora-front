                        <h2>A charm to tell so many stories</h2>
                        <p>Pandora began designing its beloved charms in the year 2000. Each charm has a meaning, some times many meanings, one from its designer and more lent to it by the person who wears and loves it. Whether itâ€™s a celebration of color or pattern or a tribute to a country, occasion, activity or most importantly, a person, each charm is designed to tell the personal story of its wearer while showcasing their unique style. Our charms are worn with love on bracelets and necklaces; created especially to be worn in ways unique to those who wear them.</p>
